# Fyodorov AI Suite
Fyodorov AI is a suite of Open Source tools for creating agents or chatbots. 
It allows you to own your agents and control them end to end without relying on a specific provider or 
any closed source technologies. It is designed to use modern DevOps principles to simplify deployment.

We are developing functionality to allow adding **tools** to agents, which will allow you to significantly 
extend their functionality.

After that we will be adding more functionality to allow adding data to give the LLM more context, using **RAG**.
